# MCuNovo Gene Selector
Select best protein codeing genes  from models Generated from MAKER2, Cufflinks and any de novo assembling programs. Previously we published a paper describing how it works. In that paper, we call it MCOT.

## This program will be availabe later, and is under devlopment.
Currently, I can only write code in python. Luckily, I've alreadly had a program works pretty good, now I need to make it easier to use, and runs faster.

Leave any comments here in github. If you are interested in using MCuNovo, I will be glad to provide help. If you have any thoughts or special needs, I can help providing a solution.

MCuNovo is developed for Manduca sexta genome project. It sees only a species will have similar amount of research performed. But in the future, there might be some changes. I can improve the program, if there is such need.

Best. :)
